<p>Dear Vendor,</p>
<p>Please be advised that ArcelorMittal Dofasco (&ldquo;AM Dofasco&rdquo;) has introduced a new program to support the payment information process. This program has been put in place to reduce the risk of fraud, protecting both your company, as our vendor, and AM Dofasco. The new program will include the three steps listed below, and must be completed in order to transact future business.</p>
<ol>
<li>AM Dofasco Online Vendor Form</li>
<li>nsKnox Application</li>
<li>Accounts Payable Video Call</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step #1 - AM Dofasco Online Vendor Form</strong></p>
<p>You are required to complete an online form using this One-time activation link <u>{ShortUrl}</u> (<u>Note: before clicking the link, please ensure you are ready to complete the on-line form as the link is only good for one-time</u>). Once you click the link, you will be directed to a Vendor Authentication screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please copy and paste your Company Name and the email address this email was sent to in the Vendor Authentication screen.&nbsp; If the Company Name is not accurate, you will be able to correct it when you are completing the online form. &nbsp;You will also need to enter the Registration Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Company Name: </strong>{CompanyName}</p>
<p><strong>Registration code:</strong> {RegCode}</p>
<p><strong>Email: </strong>{DofascoContact}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have entered the information, click Validate, a form will open for your completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also be required to attach the following documents:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Document with your company Letterhead</li>
<li>Bank Letter or Void Cheque</li>
<li>Diversity Certificate (if applicable)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Step #2 &nbsp;&ndash; nsKnox Application</u></strong></p>
<p>Please note that AM Dofasco has partnered with a Third Party company, <strong><a href="https://nsknox.net/">nsKnox</a> </strong>(located in Tel-Aviv, Israel), for the validation of your bank information to prevent financial loss due to cybercrime.&nbsp; This is for the security of both your company and AM Dofasco.&nbsp;<strong>nsKnox</strong> has been cc&rsquo;d on this email.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may contact nsKnox directly if you have any questions, and your company will be contacted by an nsKnox representative within 3 business days upon receipt of this email.</p>
<ol>
<li>To initiate the banking validation process please click on the following link: <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accountvalidation.nsknox.net/?ref=e850aef8-52bb-4d87-8bb1-f74be43def6c__;!!AB_04_y_3-SRqw!tv-Tk1qf7hyIcO0k_9UabJ2kFzT7PtQBj6nMgstHJdf4uh32TbVPo2pmJR02a558_hVDPRaP$">nsKnox Validation</a>.
<ul>
<li>Instructions are located within the website listed above</li>
<li>Please note that for the validation with nsKnox, your company <strong><u>MUST</u></strong> use the <u>same banking account details</u> where AM Dofasco will be remitting your payments (i.e. the bank letter or void cheque submitted in Step #1)
<ul>
<li>For example, if AM Dofasco will be depositing into a <u>Canadian</u> bank account (CAD), your company must validate the <u>Canadian</u> bank account with nsKnox
<ul>
<li>This means a credit card cannot be used for validation, or a different bank account</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Your company will be requested to transact a nominal payment (~$10-$15 + applicable banking fees) for the validation to occur.
<ul>
<li>Any concerns regarding the fees associated with the validation can be discussed with <a href="mailto:acctspay.dofasco@arcelormittal.com">dofasco@arcelormittal.com</a> (cc&rsquo;d on this email)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Step #3 &nbsp;&ndash; Accounts Payable Video Call</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your company will be contacted by the Accounts Payable team at AM Dofasco to conduct a video call to confirm the payment details after the completion of Step #1 and #2</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Your Company&rsquo;s new vendor application will not be processed until you have completed Steps #1 through 3.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
